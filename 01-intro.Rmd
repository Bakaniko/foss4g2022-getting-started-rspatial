# Introduction {-}

<!-- (Nicolas) Introduction to the workshop (5 min) -->

This workshops aims to provide the very basics of R to newcomers and a first 
introduction to spatial data handling in R using the [R-spatial ecosystem](https://r-spatial.org/). 
We will present to the audience mapping with the {tmap} package, vector data
handling with {sf} and raster data handling with {terra}.

No previous knowledge of R is required.

The workshop leaders are [Jakub Nowosad](https://jakubnowosad.com/) from Adam Mickiewicz University (Pozna≈Ñ, Poland) 
and [Nicolas Roelandt](https://roelandtn.frama.io/) from Gustave Eiffel university (Lyon, France).

## Schedule

- Introduction to the workshop (5 min)
- Introduction to R (15 min)
- Non-spatial data handling (30 min)
- Introduction to R-spatial ecosystem (20 min)
- Mapping in R with {tmap} (30 min)
- Pause (to be confirmed)
- Vector data processing (45 min)
- Raster data processing (45 min)
- Closing of the workshop (5 min)

## Pre-requisites


- A working installation of R (following [CRAN recommandations](https://cran.r-project.org/) for your computer)

- R packages

Please run those commands into the R console:


```{r pre-requisites-packages, eval = FALSE}
packages <- c(
  tmaptools,
  tmap,
  spData,
  sf,
  terra,
  supercells)

# Install packages from CRAN Repo
install.packages(packages)

# Install spDataLarge that is not on CRAN repo
install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://geocompr.r-universe.dev")
```


## What is ~~love~~ R ?

## Coding paradigms

When R has been released as an Open Source language, there was no strong syntax 
philosophy so there is some inconstancies in packages, functions and parameters naming
for example.
R base readibility and performances where not good enough for some users so they
developped packages to improve thoses.

When using R for data analysis, you will encounter 3 majors coding paradigms:

- R base
- [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/)

R base is vanilla R code. The Tidyverse aims to provide a more consistent grammar
 and readibility.
 Data.table provides a fast and powerful alternative to R base with a consistent
 grammar.
 
 You can mix the paradigms for your projects but for teaching purposes, the workshop 
 materials will use the Tidyverse with some R base.
