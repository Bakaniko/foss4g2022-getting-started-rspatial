# Introduction {-}

<!-- (Nicolas) Introduction to the workshop (5 min) -->

This workshops aims to provide the very basics of R to newcomers and a first 
introduction to spatial data handling in R using the [R-spatial ecosystem](https://r-spatial.org/). 
We will present to the audience mapping with the {tmap} package, vector data
handling with {sf} and raster data handling with {terra}.

No previous knowledge of R is required.

The workshop leaders are [Jakub Nowosad](https://jakubnowosad.com/) from Adam Mickiewicz University (Pozna≈Ñ, Poland) 
and [Nicolas Roelandt](https://roelandtn.frama.io/) from Gustave Eiffel university (Lyon, France).
