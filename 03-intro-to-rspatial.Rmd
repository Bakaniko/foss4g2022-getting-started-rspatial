## R's spatial ecosystem(s)

R is a powerful language for geocomputation, allowing for: 

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data processing (e.g., adding new variables)
- Data transformation (e.g., changing CRS, reducing size via simplification/aggregation)
- Data visualization
- Web application development
- Software development (e.g., to share new methods)

There are many ways to handle geographic data in R, with several dozens of packages in the area.
It includes:

- [{sf}](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf),
[{sp}](https://github.com/edzer/sp),
[{terra}](https://github.com/rspatial/terra),

Visit https://cran.r-project.org/view=Spatial to get an overview of different spatial tasks that can be solved using R.

We think it is helpful to start learning the R-spatial ecosystem by using its packages for spatial classes handling.
They offer capabilities to read/write spatial data, but also have many tools to process and transform the data.
The below figure shows the change in popularity of the main R packages for spatial data handling -- in this workshop, we will focus on {sf} for working with spatial vector data and {terra} for working with spatial raster data.

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-1}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.cap = "Source: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net"
knitr::include_graphics("https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/01-cranlogs.png")
```

## Vector data

The [{sf}](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package based on the OGC standard Simple Features.
It allows to read, process, visualize, and write various spatial data files.
As you can see in Figure \@ref(fig:03-intro-to-rspatial-2), the {sf} package does not exist in void.

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-2}
#| echo = FALSE,
#| fig.cap = "Source: https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2020/03/17/wkt.html"
knitr::include_graphics("https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.com/images/sf_deps.png")
```

First, it is built upon several external libraries, including GDAL, PROJ, GEOS, and s2geometry.
Second, it uses several R packages, such as {s2}, {units}, {DBI}.
Third, it is a basis of a few hundred of other R packages.

{sf} represent all common vector geometry types (Figure \@ref(fig:03-intro-to-rspatial-4)): points, lines, polygons and their respective ‘multi’ versions.
It also also supports geometry collections.

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-4, purl=FALSE,echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/sf-classes.png", dpi = NA)
```

Most of the functions in this package start with a prefix `st_`:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-3, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
ls("package:sf")
```

Most often, the first step in spatial data analysis in R is to read the data.
Here, we will read example file stored in the {spData} package:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-7 }
file_path = system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
file_path
```

To read a spatial vector file, we just need to provide a file path to the `read_sf()` function:^[There is also a second similar function allowing to read spatial vector files called `st_read()`.]

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-8 }
world = read_sf(file_path)
```

Our new object is an extended data frame with several non-spatial attributes and one special column `geom`.
When we print the object, it also provides a header with some basic spatial information:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-9}
world
```

We can quickly plot the object with the `plot()` function:

```{r}
plot(world)
```

It is also possible to extract all of the spatial information with several specific functions.
For example, `st_crs()` is used to get information about the coordinate reference system of the given object:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-10}
st_crs(world)
```

We can even extract different CRS definition with:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-11}
st_crs(world)$wkt
st_crs(world)$srid
st_crs(world)$proj4string
```

Let's move to a different data example.
What to do when our data is stored in a text file (instead of a spatial file format)?
Then, we can read it as a regular data frame with `read.csv`:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-14 }
cycle_hire_path = system.file("misc/cycle_hire_xy.csv", package = "spData")
cycle_hire_txt = read.csv(cycle_hire_path)
head(cycle_hire_txt)
```

Next, we need to convert it into a spatial {sf} object with `st_as_sf()` by providing which columns contain coordinates, and what is the CRS of the data:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-15}
cycle_hire_xy = st_as_sf(cycle_hire_txt, coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = "EPSG:4326")
cycle_hire_xy
```

Now, we are able to plot and analyse the data:

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-16}
plot(cycle_hire_xy)
```

We will give more example of the {sf} use in Chapter \@ref(manipulating-vector-data).

```

- The **terra** package contains classes and methods representing raster objects and operations
- It allows raster data to be loaded and saved
- It allows raster algebra and raster processing
- It includes a number of additional functions, e.g., for analysis of terrain characteristics
- It allows you to work on large sets of data
- ?`terra-package`, https://rspatial.github.io/terra/reference/terra-package.html
- It is a successor of the **raster** package - http://www.rpubs.com/etiennebr/visualraster
- The **terra** package contains classes and methods representing raster objects and operations


```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-18 }
library(terra)
elev = rast(system.file("raster/elev.tif", package = "spData"))
elev
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-19 }
plot(elev)
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-20}
elev[]
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-21 }
raster_filepath = system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
new_raster = rast(raster_filepath)
new_raster

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-22}
crs(new_raster)
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-23}
crs(new_raster, describe = TRUE, proj = TRUE)

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-24 }
raster_filepath2 = system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
new_raster2 = rast(raster_filepath2)
plot(new_raster2)
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-25}
plotRGB(new_raster2, r = 3, g = 2, b = 1, stretch = "lin")
```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-26 }
my_raster = rast(nrows = 10, ncols = 20, 
                 xmin = 0, xmax = 20, ymin = -10, ymax = 0,
                 crs = "EPSG:4326",
                 vals = 1:200)
my_raster

```

```{r 03-intro-to-rspatial-27}
plot(my_raster)
```
